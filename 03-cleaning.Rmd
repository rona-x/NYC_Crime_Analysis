# Data transformation

## Index Crime dataset

### Variable Selection 
Due to size of the original data set, we only selected the data in 2020 for the further analysis. After that, we took out observations associated with the suspect's information, since this project is more focus on the victim's perspective. We also eliminated police abbreviations and codes to make this report reader-friendly. 

#### Selected Variables 
- ID for the reported event 
- Exact date and time of crime event 
- Description of offense: burglary, forgery, robbery, etc. 
- Crime status: completed or attempted 
- Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation 
- The name of the borough in which the incident occurred 
- Specific location of the reported crime: grocery store, residence, street, etc. 
- Race of victim 
- Sex of victim 
- Latitude and Longitude of the location where the crime took place 

### Transformation Steps 
- Selected the top 10 offenses 
- Selected the top 10 specific locations 
- Created a new month number column 
- Added a new weekday column 
- Converted the exact time of crime occurrence from the HH:MM:SS format to an interval value defining a period of time in hours 

This cleaning process reduced the size of the original data set significantly and made the analysis more efficient.
