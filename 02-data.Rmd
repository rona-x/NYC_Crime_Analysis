# Data sources

The following two data sets are both directly exported as CSV files from NYC Open Data. 

## Index Crime dataset

It is a large data set which contains 35 columns and 7.38M rows. The problem with this data set lies in processing it ready for our analysis, since it might involve irrelevant information, missing values and unclear structures.

## Hate Crime dataset

This data set has 14 columns and 1,181 rows, which is a much more manageable size compared to the previous one. The only problem with it is missing values.
