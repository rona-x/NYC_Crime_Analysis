The safety problem of New York City, one the most famous cities in the world, has been a focus of discussion over the past decades. These discussions include but are not limited to topics about the most dangerous borough, sex differences in crime and racial discrimination. From a vast amount of crime news and articles, it is also noticeable that the number of hate crimes has a sharp increase in recent times. This project aims to analyze both typical criminal offenses and hate crime events in NYC from 2019 to 2021 and provide static and interactive visualizations to exhibit the results. Note: We have divided criminal acts into two primary categories: Index Crime, a term defined by the FBI, including murder, rape, robbery, etc. and Hate Crime in the following chapters. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Index Crime dataset 2.2 Hate Crime dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources The following two data sets are both directly exported as CSV files from NYC Open Data. 2.1 Index Crime dataset It is a large data set which contains 35 columns and 7.38M rows. The problem with this data set lies in processing it ready for our analysis, since it might involve irrelevant information, missing values and unclear structures. Click here to view the dataset. Collected by: Zhisen Cai 2.2 Hate Crime dataset This data set has 14 columns and 1,181 rows, which is a much more manageable size compared to the previous one. The only problem with it is missing values. Click here to view the dataset. Collected by: Rona Xu "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Index Crime dataset 3.2 Hate Crime dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Index Crime dataset 3.1.1 Variable Selection Due to size of the original data set, we only selected the data in 2020 for the further analysis. After that, we took out observations associated with the suspects information, since this project is more focus on the victims perspective. We also eliminated police abbreviations and codes to make this report reader-friendly. 3.1.1.1 Selected Variables ID for the reported event Exact date and time of crime event Description of offense: burglary, forgery, robbery, etc. Crime status: completed or attempted Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation The name of the borough in which the incident occurred Specific location of the reported crime: grocery store, residence, street, etc. Race of victim Sex of victim Latitude and Longitude of the location where the crime took place 3.1.2 Transformation Steps Selected the top 10 offenses Selected the top 10 specific locations Created a new month number column Added a new weekday column Converted the exact time of crime occurrence from the HH:MM:SS format to an interval value defining a period of time in hours This cleaning process reduced the size of the original data set significantly and made the analysis more efficient. 3.2 Hate Crime dataset 3.2.1 Variable Selection For this relatively small and neat data set, we only took out a few features, including police terminology, arrest date and arrest ID. 3.2.1.1 Selected Variables Year of the complaint Month of the complaint Borough name Level of offense Offense category: race, gender, religion, etc. Bias motive description: Anti-Asian, Anti-Transgender, Anti-Muslim, etc. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing data would substantially affect the precision of the analysis and could lead to wrong prediction as well as conclusion. In this chapter, we examined the missing data in the two data sets. However, after data cleaning and transformation, there is no missing value in the hate crime data set. Consequently, we mainly focused on the missing values in the index crime data set. From the plot above, it is recognizable that most cases are complete, with no missing value. Location, County and Offense are the three most apparent missing features among 10. They have 1,104, 463 and 5 missing rows respectively. We took a further step to analyze the significance of these missing variables and presented it in the following plot. In this large data set containing over 40K rows, the percentages of missing Location and County rows are both less than 0.3%, and offense is not even noticeable. In this way, we concluded that the existence of missing values in this data set does not have significant statistical power of producing biased results. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Index Cirme Analysis 5.2 Hate Crime Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Index Cirme Analysis 5.1.1 NYC Crime Map The distribution of crime events presented in this map provided us with a general idea that Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn have the highest crime rate among the five boroughs in NYC. 5.1.2 Factor: Time Range In general, the number of crimes committed increases hourly from 6 a.m. through afternoon, peaks at 6 p.m., and then slowly drops to a low point at 6 a.m. Among the five boroughs, Brooklyn has the highest crime rate of all time, following by Manhattan and Bronx. Conversely, Staten Island has the lowest. The distribution of the number of crimes has a similar shape regardless of the level of offense across time periods. 5.1.3 Factor: Level Crimes categorized as misdemeanor are committed the most among those three levels. Other findings by borough: \\(\\circ\\) Brooklyn has the highest crime rate in all categories, and Staten Island has the lowest. \\(\\circ\\) Manhattan has the lowest crime rate of violation. \\(\\circ\\) The distribution of crimes by level seems to be similar between Bronx and Queens. 5.1.4 Factors: Location, Sex Most crimes committed in NYC occurred on the street, followed by residential property and public property, namely Chain store and commercial building. When speaking of levels of crime, felonies and misdemeanors are most committed on the street, and violations happened the most in apartment house. This heatmap exhibits the relationship between offense and location in a more detailed way. Harassment most happened in residence house, petit larceny and criminal mischief were committed most on the street. This plot also verified that street is the most common place that a crime took place. Females have more harassment and assault experience than their male counterparts in 2020, which might be caused by gender inequality and female objectification. Another interesting finding is that petit larceny, a theft of property that has a relatively low value, happened to men more often. From our perspective, the possible reason might lie in the fact that most men are not used to bring a bag to carry possessions when going out. 5.2 Hate Crime Analysis 5.2.1 Factors: Bias, Borough Kings(Brooklyn) has the highest number of hate crime events in general, followed by New York(Manhattan) and Queens; Richmond(Staten Island) has the lowest. Among these bias motivations, Anti-Jewish appears to be the most common one. In order to further examine it, we picked the top five bias motivations, including Anti-Jewish, Anti-Asian, Anti-Male homosexual, Anti-Black and Anti-White, and presented the number of motivations by borough in the following graph. From this plot, it is apparent that Anti-Jewish hate crimes occurred the most in Kings. Anti-Asian, Anti-Male homosexual, Anti-Black and Anti-White hate crimes are all committed the most in New York. Most hate crime events were motivated by bias against race/color, religion/religious practice and sexual orientation. In addition, Jewish is the most targeted religion group; Asian is the most targeted race, and Male-homosexual is the most targeted sexual orientation by hate crimes. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The goal of this chapter is to produce an interactive plot indicating the increase of hate crime events against race, specifically Asian, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected the data from 2020 to 2021 in the NYC hate crime data set and four races of Asian, Black, Hispanic and White to do comparison. From the plot, it is obvious that there is a sharp increase of Anti-Asian hate crimes in the New York City during the pandemic. It might be resulted from COVID-19 stigma and misinformation, such as slurs like Kung Flu and China virus as well as the lab-leak hypothesis. Click here to view the interactive plot.
